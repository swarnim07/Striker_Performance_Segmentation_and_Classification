# -Striker-Performance-Segmentation-and-Classification

📌 Overview
his project focuses on using unsupervised machine learning techniques to analyze and segment striker performance data in professional football. The aim is to provide a data-driven scouting solution to identify and classify players into meaningful performance tiers. The entire project was executed using Python in Google Colab, leveraging popular data science libraries.

🎯 Objective
To help football clubs make data-driven decisions by analyzing player stats and grouping strikers into:

Regular Performers

Best Players

🧾 Dataset
Source: Kaggle

~500 rows × 25+ features

Metrics: Goals, xG, Assists, Pass Accuracy, etc.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies
Python, Google Colab

Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib

Scikit-learn (PCA, KMeans, Hierarchical Clustering)

🔍 Steps Followed
  Data Cleaning & EDA: Handled missing values, visualized KPIs

  Dimensionality Reduction: PCA to simplify features

  Clustering: KMeans & Hierarchical Clustering

  Insight Generation: Segmented players & summarized findings

  Handled workflow: cleaning, EDA, modeling, visualization

  Created summary for non-technical understanding

🏆 Outcome
